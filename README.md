# SDL2-Game
A short 2D game made with a specialized 2D game engine.

Built to explore some data-driven design concepts, the engine is very specialized for this type of top-down 2D game rather than a generalized tool. The engine loads in GUI positions & functionality for certain states (Main menu, Pause Menu, etc...) as well as parsing 2D levels built with TILED (.tmx files).

To prevent crashing, make sure the "data" and "res" folders are in the same directory as the SDL_ENGINE executable.

Technologies used:
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- tinyxml
- zlib
